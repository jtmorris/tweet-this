Tweet This offers easily embedded, stylish tweetable content boxes in your
posts and pages. Get your visitors sharing on Twitter today!


== Description ==
All the pros agree. Sharing your content on Twitter is an immensely powerful, and
essential, marketing tool for modern websites and blogs.

But do you know what is 100 times more effective than you sharing your stuff?
Your *readers* sharing it!  Not only does word of mouth vastly increase your
market reach, but your authority and the power of your message explodes
exponentially.

= Getting Readers Active =
But there's a problem.  The standard "share" methods are impersonal
and difficult for your readers.  Those share buttons at the bottom of your page?
They don't send anything inspiring!  Just a lifeless message and ugly link.
What you need is Tweet This!

Tweet This is the perfect tool for encouraging your readers to share.  You get to
write a short message.  This message gets embedded into your post or page in an
attractive manner.  When a reader clicks your embedded content, they are given an
opportunity to send the message as a tweet along with a link back to your post.

All you have to do is pick your most engaging quotes or content, load them into a
Tweet This box, and watch your readers spread it to the far corners of the globe!




= How Does It Work? =
Tweet This works using shortcodes.  Simply use the shortcode to embed your text
anywhere you like.  When viewed, the shortcode displays either a beautiful box containing
your message, as well as subtle encouragement for your readers to tweet it, or a simple
inline link.  It's your choice how to display it.

When they decide to tweet it and click the box/link, the message will automatically be filled into
 a Twitter post box for them, as well as a link back to your content and your Twitter account if so desired.

Tweet This is immensely customizable.  You can change the look of your Tweet
This boxes.  Setup the use of shortlinks in place of long URLs.  And much more!
